# Eerie (Modpack)

## Shouldn't it be calming to hear the birds chirp?

This modpack is meant to bring back the scariness and eerieness that old Minecraft had. It was originally inspired by [Alpha Oxtrot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h7J_PQdYXg), but has grown over the years into its own project.

This is listed as a terror modpack because that is primarily how it operates. There are no scary monsters added, just an unsettling atmosphere. Also, it should be noted that this is made for actual gameplay and not necessarily content creation.
