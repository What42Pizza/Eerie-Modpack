## Playthrough Readme

### Settings

- Keep your render distance as high as your computer can comfortable handle while loading chunks. Don't worry about the fog, you cannot affect the fog
- Keep the volume high. Don't worry, there aren't any loud jumpscares
- Don't change any other settings unless necessary
- The shader does have settings but again, please don't change anything unless it's necessary

### Accessability

- For a brighter night, go to shader settings / DEBUG_ONLY / Night Brightness
- To stop the handheld light from strobing (because of a low update rate), go to Game Menu / Mods / LambDynamicLights / Configure / Dynamic Lights and set it to Fancy
