This is a list of all the mods which I've chosen to not include and why.

- Borderless Mining
Causes vsync to be permanently disabled (at least for me)

- Concurrent Chunk Management Engine
This seems to create many lighting bugs and I don't think it's worth the performance increase I saw

- Cubes Without Borders
Requires Fabric 0.15.0+, which is incompatible with something here

- Death Compass
I want there to be a constant feeling of difficulty, and this mod goes against that

- Exordium
Doesn't work well with Essentials

- Klee Slabs
I want there to be a constant feeling of difficulty, and this mod goes against that

- Memory Leak Fix
Requires Fabric 0.15.0+, which is incompatible with something here

- Modern Fix
This seems to create random fps drops which are especially bad in the nether

- Replay Mod
Incompatible with something here, plus I feel like it would kinda ruin the feel of this modpack
