### Settings

- Keep your render distance as high as your computer can comfortable handle while loading chunks. Don't worry about the fog, you cannot affect the fog
- Keep the volume high. Don't worry, there aren't any loud jumpscares
- Don't change any other settings unless necessary
- The shader does have settings but again, please don't change anything unless it's necessary

<br>

### Accessability

- For a brighter night, go to shader settings / DEBUG_ONLY / Night Brightness
- To stop the handheld light from flickering (because of a low update rate), go to Game Menu / Mods / LambDynamicLights / Configure / Dynamic Lights and set it to Off, then go to shader settings / DEBUG_ONLY / Shader Torchlight and turn it On

<br>

### Multiplayer

This modpack is fully compatible with the Essentials mod, which is how I recommend doing multiplayer. Though of course, you can look for your own solutions
