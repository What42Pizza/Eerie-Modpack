## Playthrough Readme

This is a list of basic knowledge you should have when playing this modpack (if you find anything listed here that is incorrect, please let me know)

<br>

### Settings

- Keep your render distance as high as your computer can comfortable handle while loading chunks. Don't worry about the fog, you cannot affect the fog
- Keep the volume high. Don't worry, there aren't any loud jumpscares
- Don't change any other settings unless necessary
- The shader does have settings but again, please don't change anything unless it's necessary

<br>

### Accessability

- For a brighter night, go to shader settings / DEBUG_ONLY / Night Brightness
- To stop the handheld light from flickering (because of a low update rate), go to Game Menu / Mods / LambDynamicLights / Configure / Dynamic Lights and set it to Off, then go to shader settings / DEBUG_ONLY / Shader Torchlight and turn it On

<br>

### Multiplayer

[E4mc](https://modrinth.com/mod/e4mc) is used for online multiplayer without port-forwarding. For others to join you, you must:
- 1: Open any world in singleplayer and open it to lan
- 2: Share the server domain given by E4mc (it should look something like "apple-orange.na.e4mc.link") and tell others to put it in the Server Address slot for either Direct Connect or Add Server
