This is a list of all the mods which I've chosen to not include and why.

- Concurrent Chunk Management Engine
This seems to create many lighting bugs and I don't think it's worth the performance increase I saw

- Death Compass
I want there to be a constant feeling of difficulty, and this mod goes against that

- Klee Slabs
I want there to be a constant feeling of difficulty, and this mod goes against that

- Modern Fix
This seems to create a lot of lag, especially in the nether, maybe is just a coincidence, probably needs more testing
